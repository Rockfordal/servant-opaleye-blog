Assumptions: Have gone through Servant and Opaleye tutorials, need something on how to put it together 
for a real application

- Separate out APIs
- Create Api directory
- Create User API
- Move over User info
- Create Email type, since will be passed around (Create App file, since used in multiple contexts)
- Create JSON instance (so password never gets turned into JSON)
- Add Server
- Add functions
- Abstract out EitherT ServantErr IO ... to App.hs

- Do similar with BlogPost

- Edit Cabal file
- Add dependencies
- Add modules
